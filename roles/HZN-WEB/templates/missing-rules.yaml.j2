Some policy rules that are still required by Horizon aren't generated by
the oslo policy generator. These rules are maintained in this template and
end up in a separate policy configuration file in the horizon file structure
(under openstack_dashboard/conf/nova_policy.d/missing-rules.yaml).

NOTE: do not remove this file, even if all the listed rules are removed due to
future bug fixes, otherwise the missing-rules.yaml file previously generated
will be left on the target systems with deprecated contents.

os_compute_api:servers:attach_volume addresses bsc#1094184 (attach volume policy
rule in generated file is a mismatch for rule in code)

"os_compute_api:servers:attach_volume": "rule:admin_or_owner"
